Instruction:
Left and Right arrows: to navigate between each new object
Insert key: Insert new object
Delete key: delete selected object
Space key: Select a object for joint (should show in purple)
All other settings are in GUI for creating new objects and pausing physics
Create Joint by selecting one object and navigate to another then insert joint
Gravity and Timestep will be unchangable

Improvments to be made:
More objects types to use in scene
More Joint types to use in scene
Collision could be done on objects instead of physics scene
Rigidbody could become optional attachment instead of inherited
Better UI for app (Wanted to use diffrent method to click, but was not as effective)
